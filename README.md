**droneLifeguard**
===============
----------


droneLifeguard is a project that will help lifeguards and beach supervisors save more lives under difficult circumstances.

**Scenario**: You are in a very large beach and you suddenly see someone drowning at very large distance from the lifeguard and the shoreline. You call it in and the lifeguard runs to the shoreline and starts to swim to the place that the drowning victim was last seen. 
Now take into account how much valuable time was wasted during lifeguards' necessary actions.
The answer is a lot, and in emergency situations time is the difference between life and death!

**Solution**:  An emergency response drone is deployed carrying a lifebelt that flies quickly to the person in need, from there it drops the lifebelt to the person, so there is enough time for the lifeguard to reach the person. This works even if the victim and the lifeguard are a long distance apart and the sea current is not favorable to reach the victim.

**Pros**:
 1. A beach supervisor could control the drone, without necessarily being a lifeguard.
 2. The whole payload delivery system is very fast.
 3. Lives can be saved, by minimising response time.
 4. The project is based on open source software and hardware and itself is **open source**!
